.SH NAME
hxascdmp \- hexadecimal ASCII dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hxascdmp
[\fI\-b=BPL\fR] [\fI\-h\fR] [\fI\-H\fR] [\fI\-N\fR] [\fI\-V\fR]
[\fIFILE+\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
This utility reads one or more \fIFILE\fR names and dumps them in hexadecimal
and ASCII to stdout. If no \fIFILE\fR is given then stdin is read instead;
reading continues (or stalls) until an EOF is received.
.PP
The default format is to start each line with the hexadecimal address (offset
from the start of file) followed by 16 hexadecimal bytes separated by a
single space (apart from the 8th and 9th bytes which are separated by two
spaces). If the \fI\-H\fR is not given, there is then a string of 16 ASCII
characters corresponding to the hexadecimal bytes earlier in the line; only
bytes in the range 0x20 to 0x7e are printed in ASCII, other bytes values are
printed as '.' . If the \fI\-H\fR is not given, each \fIFILE\fR name that
appears on the command line is printed on a separate line prior to that
file's hexadecimal ASCII dump.
.PP
If the \fI\-N\fR option is given then no address is printed out and each
line starts with the next hexadecimal byte.
.PP
This utility is pretty close to the 'hexdump -C' variant of BSD's
.B hexdump(1)
command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fR=\fIBPL\fR
where \fIBPL\fR specifies the number of bytes per line. The default value is
16. 16 bytes per line is just enough to allow the address, 16 bytes in
hexadecimal followed by 16 bytes as ASCII to fit on a standard 80 column
wide terminal.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR
output hexadecimal only (i.e. don't place an ASCII representation at the
end of each line).
.TP
\fB\-N\fR
no address; so each line starts with the next hexadecimal byte.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
In Windows the given file (or files) are set to binary mode.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of hxascdmp is 0 when it is successful. If any of the
given \fIFILE\fR names cannot be opened then the exit status is 1.
.SH EXAMPLES
First we manufacture a short file with a mix of data in it: mostly ASCII with
some control characters and 0xaa (which the echo command only accepts in
octal (0252):
.PP
   $ echo -e "three blind mice,\t\r\0252" > 3bm.txt
.PP
Now we use this utility to see exactly what is in the file. To avoid
problems with line wrapping, the bytes per line option is set to 8:
.PP
   $ hxascdmp -b=8 3bm.txt
.br
ASCII hex dump of file: 3bm.txt
.br
 00      74 68 72 65  65 20 62 6c   three bl
.br
 08      69 6e 64 20  6d 69 63 65   ind mice
.br
 10      2c 09 0d aa  0a            ,....
.PP
Using the same file, use this utility to output only hexadecimal formatted
16 bytes per line.
.PP
   $ hxascdmp -H 3bm.txt
.br
hex dump of file: 3bm.txt
.br
 00      74 68 72 65 65 20 62 6c  69 6e 64 20 6d 69 63 65
.br
 10      2c 09 0d aa 0a
.PP
For comparison the hexdump utility gives similar output:
.PP
   $ hexdump -C 3bm.txt
.br
00000000  74 68 72 65 65 20 62 6c  69 6e 64 20 6d 69 63 65  |three blind mice|
.br
00000010  2c 09 0d aa 0a                                    |,....|
