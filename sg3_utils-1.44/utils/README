This directory contains these utilities:
  - hxascdmp: takes a binary stream and converts it to hexadecimal ASCII
    which is sent to stdout. The incoming binary stream can either be
    from a file or, in the absence of a file name, from stdin. Similar to
    the Unix "od" command. By default, it decodes 16 bytes per line with
    an ASCII interpretation to the right of each line. See its
    hxascdmp(1) man page.
  - sg_chk_asc and tst_sg_lib: are no longer here, they have been moved
    to the 'testing' directory (a sibling of this directory).


By default, the Makefile only builds the hxascdmp utility. The 'Makefile'
file (i.e. with no suffix) builds for Linux; the 'Makefile.freebsd' file
builds for FreeBSD (e.g. 'make -f Makefile.freebsd'); the
'Makefile.solaris' file builds for Solaris; the 'Makefile.mingw' builds
in the Windows MinGW environment (e.g.  msys shell); and 'Makefile.cygwin'
builds in the Windows Cygwin environment.
