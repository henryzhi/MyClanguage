# 64 byte NVMe Identify controller command (an Admin command) that is
# suitable for:
#       sg_raw --cmdfile=<this_file_name> --request=4096 <nvme_device>
#
# The address field (at byte offset 24, 8 bytes and little endian) gives
# special meaning to the highest address pointers:
#    ffffffff fffffffe         use address of data-in buffer
#    ffffffff fffffffd         use address of data-out buffer
#
# The data length field (at byte offset 36, 4 bytes and little endian)
# gives special meaning to the highest block counts:
#    fffffffe                  use byte length of data-in buffer
#    fffffffd                  use byte length of data-out buffer
#
# Since The Identify command reads data "in" from the device, then the
# data-in buffer is appropriate.

# A typical invocation in Linux and FreeBSD would look like this:
#    sg_raw --cmdfile=nvme_identify_ctl.hex -r 4k /dev/nvme0
#
# NVMe likes "4k" (4096 bytes) buffer size, preferably aligned to
# a 4096 byte (or "page") boundary.
