Building files in this directory depends on several files being already
built in the ../lib directory. So to build files here, the ./configure
needs to be executed in the parent directory followed by changing
directory to the lib directory and calling 'make' there.
Another way is to do a top level 'make' after the ./configure which
will make the libraries followed by all the utilities in the src/
directory. To make them in FreeBSD use 'make -f Makefile.freebsd' .

There is an brief explanation of each example in the README file in
the main (i.e. this directory's parent) directory. There are also
some notes at the top of each source file.

Some files that were previously in this directory have been moved to
the 'testing' directory.
