# This file is an example for the sg_reassign utility.
# That utility can take one or more logical block addresses from stdin when
# either the '--address=-" or "-a -" option is given on the command line.

# To see logical block addresses placed in the command parameter block
# without executing them command try something like:
# 'sg_reassign --address=- --dummy -vv /dev/sda < reassign_addr.txt
