# 64 byte NVMe Device Self Test command (an Admin command) that is suitable
# for:
#       sg_raw --cmdfile=<this_file_name> <nvme_device>
#
# There is no data-in or data-out associated with this command. This command
# is optional so check the Identify controller command response to see if
# it is supported.
#
# The following invocation will self test the controller and all its
# namespaces (since nsid=0xffffffff) and does a "short" self test on each
# one (since CDW10 is 0x1).
