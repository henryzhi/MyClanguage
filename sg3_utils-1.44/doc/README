Various html files used to be included in this directory but they were
beginning to bloat the size of the source tarball so they have been
removed in version 1.24 .

Here are the urls of the files that were previously here plus a brief
summary:

There are two versions of sg_scan: one for Linux and the other for Windows.
They have different man pages: sg_scan.8.linux and sg_scan.8.win32 with
the Makefile logic (rule in Makefile.am) copying the appropriate one to
sg_scan.8 . sg_scan is not supported for other ports.
