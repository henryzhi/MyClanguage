\fIDEVICE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Fetches enclosure status (via a SCSI READ BUFFER command).
The \fIDEVICE\fR should be a SAF\-TE device which may be a storage
array controller (INQUIRY peripheral device type 0xc) or a generic
processor device (INQUIRY peripheral device type 0x3).
.PP
If no options are given (only the \fIDEVICE\fR argument) then the
overall enclosure status as reported by the option
.I
\-\-config
.R
is reported.
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
The options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR
will issues a
.I
Read Enclosure Configuration
.R
(READ BUFFER ID 0) cdb to the device, which returns a list of the
enclosure hardware resources.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-devstatus\fR
will issue a
.I
Read Device Slot Status
.R
(READ BUFFER ID 4) cdb to the device, which returns information about
the current state of each drive or slot.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-encstatus\fR
will issue a
.I
Read Enclosure Status
.R
(READ BUFFER ID 1) cdb to the device, which returns the operational
state of the components.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-flags\fR
will issue a
.I
Read Global Flags
.R
(READ BUFFER ID 5) cdb to the device, which read the most recent state
of the global flags of the RAID processor device.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response to a READ BUFFER command in ASCII hex to stdout. If used
once, output the response to the first READ BUFFER command (i.e. with
buffer_id=0). This should be the enclosure configuration. If used twice (or
more often), the response to subsequent READ BUFFER commands is output.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-insertions\fR
will issue a
.I
Read Device Insertions
.R
(READ BUFFER ID 3) cdb to the device, which returns information about
the number of times devices have been inserted whilst the RAID system
was powered on.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output the response to a READ BUFFER command in binary to stdout. If used
once, output the response to the first READ BUFFER command (i.e. with
buffer_id=0). This should be the enclosure configuration. If used twice (or
more often), the response to subsequent READ BUFFER commands is output.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-usage\fR
will issue a
.I
Read Usage Statistics
.R
(READ BUFFER ID 2) cdb to the device, which returns the information on
total usage time and number of power\-on cycles of the RAID device.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
This implementation is based on the intermediate review document dated
19970414 and named "SR041497.pdf". So it is quite old. Intel and nStor
are the authors. Intel have a zip archive containing this and related
documents in the "SAF\-TE: SCSI Accessed Fault Tolerant Enclosures
Interface Specification" section of this page:

.PP
Similar functionality is provided by SPC\-4 SCSI Enclosure Services (SES)
devices (Peripheral device type 0xd), which can be queried with the
sg_ses utility.
.SH EXAMPLES
To view the configuration:
.PP
   sg_safte /dev/sg1
.PP
To view the device slot status:
.PP
   sg_safte \-\-devstatus /dev/sg1
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_safte is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
