.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sends a SCSI REPORT ZONES command to \fIDEVICE\fR and outputs the data
returned. This command is found in the ZBC draft standard, revision
4c (zbc\-r04c.pdf).
.SH OPTIONS
Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
output the usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hex\fR
output the response in hexadecimal to stdout. When used once the whole
response is output in ASCII hexadecimal with a leading address (starting at
0) on each line. When used twice each zone descriptor in the response is
output separately in hexadecimal. When used thrice the whole response is
output in hexadecimal with no leading address (on each line).
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-maxlen\fR=\fILEN\fR
where \fILEN\fR is the (maximum) response length in bytes. It is placed in
the cdb's "allocation length" field. If not given (or \fILEN\fR is zero)
then 8192 is used. The maximum allowed value of \fILEN\fR is 1048576.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partial\fR
set the PARTIAL bit in the cdb.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
output the SCSI response (i.e. the data\-out buffer) in binary (to stdout).
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-readonly\fR
open the \fIDEVICE\fR read\-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag).
The default is to open it read\-write.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-report\fR=\fIOPT\fR
where \fIOPT\fR will become the contents of the REPORTING OPTION field
in the cdb. The default value is 0 which means report a list of all zones.
Some other values are 1 for list zones with a zone condition of empty; 2 for
list zones with a zone condition of implicitly opened; 3 for list zones with
a zone condition of explicitly opened; 4 for list zones with a zone condition
of closed; 5 for list zones with a zone condition of full; 6 for list zones
with a zone condition of read only; 7 for list zones with a zone condition of
offline. Other values are 0x10 for list zones with RWP recommended set to
true; 0x11 for list zones with non\-sequential write resource active set to
true and 0x3f for list zones with a zone condition of not write pointer.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR=\fILBA\fR
where \fILBA\fR is at the start or within the first zone to be reported. The
default value is 0. If \fILBA\fR is not a zone start LBA then the preceding
zone start LBA is used for reporting. Assumed to be in decimal unless
prefixed with '0x' or has a trailing 'h' which indicate hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of sg_rep_zones is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.
